# Summary

A basic version of a file transfer website such as WeTransfer or Firefox Send.

# User stories

## MVP
• As a sending user I want to be able to upload one or more files and obtain a URL link which I
can share with other people so they can access those files.
• As a receiving user I want to be able to visit a link I have received from a sending user so I
can download the files.

## Nice to have
• The sending user can upload multiple files
• The generated links make use of a pseudo-random token to prevent guessing
• The sending user can specify a password which the receiving user must enter before being able to download them
• The sending user can specify for how long the generated link should be considered valid
• The sending user can drag-and-drop the files they wish to upload
• The sending user sees a progress bar is displayed during file upload
